# UsingRebelsToDefyVegas

- In the project, Lane Kiffin's pre-game interviews are analyzed to determine whether they can be used to predict game outcomes against the spread and over/under.

- Transcripts of interviews and game data were collected over multiple seasons by the team. A variety of techniques were used to analyze the text, including lift analysis, sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, word vectors, topic modeling, and BERT. However, none of these natural language techniques were effective in predicting wins or losses.

- A neural network speech emotion recognition system was developed to analyze Kiffin's emotional inflection during interviews. A prediction model based on emotion analysis performed 21-27% better than base odds when tested.

- During the emotion analysis, Kiffin's true thoughts about upcoming games were evident in his vocal inflections, even when his words were guarded. Depending on the opponent, the predominant emotion varies week to week.

- There are several limitations to the analysis, including the fact that it is coach-specific and computationally intensive to recreate. Nevertheless, the method shows promise for revealing insights from public figures who are trying to conceal information through the use of vocal analysis.
